# Expo Image Component Error: 'undefined is not an object'

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Image component: the `undefined is not an object` error. This often arises from issues with the image source URI or network connectivity.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows how the error manifests.  The Expo Image component fails to render an image due to an incorrect or inaccessible image source URI.  This leads to the runtime error 'undefined is not an object'.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version. The solution focuses on carefully validating and checking the image source.  Error handling is added to gracefully manage situations where the image fails to load.  This improved handling avoids the crash, offering a better user experience.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
5. Observe the error in `bug.js` and the corrected behavior in `bugSolution.js`.
