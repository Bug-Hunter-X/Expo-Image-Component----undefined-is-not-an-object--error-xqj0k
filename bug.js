This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a source URI that's improperly formatted or points to an inaccessible resource.  The `source` prop expects a specific structure, and deviations from this can lead to the `undefined is not an object` error. For example, if the URI is incorrect (typo, missing trailing slash, etc.) or if the image server is down, the component won't be able to load the image data. This can also happen due to network issues, especially when fetching images from a remote server.  Ensure your app has appropriate network permissions and error handling.
